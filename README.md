# DONE 🎉

Welcome to **DONE**, the revolutionary programming language where every command is just the word "DONE"! When everything is DONE, nothing is left to do.

## 🚀 Features

- Everything is DONE
- No syntax errors (it's always DONE)
- Maximum productivity (you're always DONE)
- Zero learning curve (just write DONE)
- 100% bug-free (if it's DONE, it's DONE)

## 📋 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymorsi7/DONE
cd DONE
```

2. Compile the interpreter:
```bash
g++ interpreter.cpp -o DONE
```

3. Make the interpreter executable:
```bash
chmod +x DONE
```

## 💻 Usage

Run a DONE program:
```bash
./DONE examples/hello.done
```

## 🌟 Language Specification

In DONE, context is everything. Here's how to use DONE:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `DONE` | Prints "Done." |
| `DONE DONE` | Increments the counter |
| `DONE DONE DONE DONE` | Prints "Hello, DONE!" |

## 📝 Example Programs

### Hello World
```plaintext
DONE DONE DONE DONE
```
Output:
```
Hello, DONE!
```

### Count to Ten
```plaintext
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
DONE DONE
```
Output:
```
Total DONEs counted: 10
Execution finished. DONE.
```

## 🔨 Creating Your Own Programs

1. Create a new file with `.done` extension
2. Write DONE as many times as needed based on what you want to accomplish
3. Save and run with the interpreter

## 📚 Best Practices

1. Keep your DONEs organized
2. Use empty lines to separate logical blocks of DONE
3. Comment your code by adding more DONEs
4. When in doubt, just write DONE

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
./DONE tests/test_hello.done
./DONE tests/test_count.done
```

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingDone`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some DONE'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingDone`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## 🎯 Future Roadmap

- Add support for multiple DONEs

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Thanks to everyone who has ever finished something
- Special thanks to all the DONEs that made this possible
- Dedicated to those who just want to be DONE with it

Remember: In DONE, you're always just one DONE away from being done!
