# DoneLang Specification

DoneLang is a minimalist language where every command is simply **DONE**. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **One `DONE`**: Prints "Done."
- **Two `DONE` on a line**: Increments a hidden counter.
- **Four `DONE` on a line**: Prints "Hello, DoneLang!"
- **Empty lines** are ignored.
